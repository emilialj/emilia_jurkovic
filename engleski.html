        <p class="par">A tattoo is a decoration, a memory and something that will mark us for the rest of our lives. How much
the master puts effort into your tattoo or piercing so that it looks high-quality, beautiful
and you have endured the years that follow so much and you are expected to take care of yours
new tattoo!
Maintenance of the tattoo:
At the very end of the tattooing, a transparent film (transparent film for the household) is placed, which will
protect your tattoo from external influences for the first few hours after tattooing. The foil is removed
2.3 hours after or 24 hours after the tattoo itself, depending on the size of the tattoo itself and yours
obligations afterwards.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"><br><br>
Note: nowadays tegaderm, suprasorb, etc. are used (artificial
skin) which is intended for keeping the tattoo in the first 4-5 days and in the aforementioned
period, he does not remove the foil unless the instructions of the tattoo artist stated otherwise
after removing the foil, the tattoo is rinsed in lukewarm water, remove it from the tattoo with light movements
excess ink, lymph, blood and blood that will be secreted while the tattoo is under the foil.
After washing, dry the tattoo with a towel or a clean towel. Lymph can be secreted up to 48 hours after tattooing
it is necessary to protect the tattoo with foil. Considering that the skin cannot breathe under the foil, it is important
know that wearing a tattoo for too long and too often can cause inflammation, so whenever you are in
If possible, keep the weighing machine in the air, lubricated and without contact with bedding, fabric, etc
dirt.<br><br>
In case the fabric (shirt, pants...) is over your tattoo, it is important to make sure that
the clothes are clean and airy. This is very important for the first 1.2 days overnight to prevent the fabric
or bedding to stick to the lymph and damage the tattoo, the tattoo is a superficial wound, and it heals only after a new layer of skin is formed over it. This
the skin is thin and sensitive within the first 2 weeks to a month and it is necessary to take care of everything
factors that could result in tattoo damage!
The tattoo needs to be smeared with bephanten ointment (mr. ink, easy tattoo, hustle
butter... or some similar professional tattoo care products) 3 to 4 times a day
within 2 weeks of the tattoo itself in order to prevent the possible formation of a scab and to
your tattoo was oily, which is a prerequisite for good healing. The grease is also applied clean
hands in light, thin layers so that the skin can "breathe" the garment that will cover it
the tattoo needs to be clean and airy.<br><br>
The tattoo begins to peel (flake) within a couple of days over a period of 2 weeks, which is normal
healing process, also itching, redness and burning that will stop after a few days depending on
the skin, also the size and location of the tattoo.
It is important to know that the tattoo should not be soaked (bath, pool, sea...).
When showering, be careful not to apply shampoos, soaps, lotions, etc. to the tattoo itself
unless it's ph neutral soaps with which you can wash off your tattoo unhindered,
when showering, water flowing freely over the tattoo is not a problem, it is only important that
it does not get soaked as we have already mentioned. Also, if you play sports, it is important to know that you should
watch out for sweating and refrain from training for at least 5 days after the tattoo itself.</span>

        Tattooing is typically charged per hour, session, or based on a fixed price, depending on the size, complexity, and location of the tattoo. Therefore, it's best to contact a specific tattoo studio to get an exact price based on your preferences.

    <div id="collapseTwo" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="headingTwo" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample">

Tattoo studios typically have galleries of tattoo pictures categorized by themes such as flowers, animals, tribal designs, symbols, etc. You can browse such galleries to get inspiration for a tattoo on a specific part of the body. Once you select a design you like, you can reach out to the artist to discuss the details of the tattoo and get a price estimate.
